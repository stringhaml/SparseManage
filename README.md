Manage sparse files in Windows Vista and later.

MakeSparse can accept -p to preserve the file times of the file being modified.
It also accepts -m to print a sparse cluster map.

CopySparse accepts -p to preserve the timestamps from the original file if
desired.

PipeSparse is useful to extract compressed files directly to sparse files.

I hope you find these tools useful, and if you're so inclined, help contribute
to making them better.

Happy Hacking!
